# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Summary
BidSmart is an AI-powered auction intelligence platform that predicts auction prices and suggests winning bidding strategies for collectors and resellers across major auction platforms. The tool analyzes thousands of completed auctions to provide instant price predictions with confidence intervals, comparable sales data, and custom bidding strategies tailored to each item.

## 2. Target User
Casual collectors and professional resellers who participate in online auctions on platforms like eBay, Heritage Auctions, and LiveAuctioneers. Casual collectors are frustrated by overpaying or losing bids due to lack of pricing knowledge. Professional resellers need better profit margins and inventory management tools. Both groups value data-driven decision making over gut-feeling bidding and want to know exactly what items are worth before placing bids.

## 3. Core Problem
Most people lose money at auctions because they're bidding blind—they see something they want, guess what it's worth, and either overpay or get outbid by someone who knows something they don't. There's no centralized way to access historical auction data, price predictions, or strategic bidding guidance across multiple platforms. Collectors and resellers lack the tools to make informed decisions about when to bid, how much to offer, and when to walk away.

## 4. Value Proposition
BidSmart transforms uncertain auction bidding into data-driven profit optimization. Users upload a photo or paste a listing link and instantly receive price predictions with confidence intervals, comparable sales data, and custom bidding strategies. For a vintage watch, it might say "This will likely sell for $800-$1,200, bid up to $850 in the final 30 seconds." The tool eliminates guesswork and turns gut-feeling bidders into data-driven profit machines who never wonder "what's this really worth?" again.

## 5. Core Features
- Multi-platform auction analysis (eBay, Heritage Auctions, LiveAuctioneers, and other major platforms)
- Instant price prediction with confidence intervals based on thousands of completed auctions
- Comparable sales data showing recent sales of similar items and grades
- Custom bidding strategies with specific timing and maximum bid recommendations
- Photo upload or listing link analysis for instant insights
- Bulk analysis and profit margin tracking for professional resellers
- Inventory management and tax reporting for pro users
- Alerts when underpriced items hit the market

## 6. Differentiators
Unlike single-platform tools or manual research, BidSmart provides cross-platform intelligence that works across eBay, Heritage Auctions, LiveAuctioneers, and other major auction sites. The tool doesn't just show historical data—it provides actionable bidding strategies with specific timing recommendations (e.g., "bid up to $850 in the final 30 seconds"). For professional resellers, it includes inventory management, profit tracking, and tax reporting in one platform. At scale, white-label solutions for auction houses create a B2B revenue stream that competitors don't offer.

## 7. Homepage Angle
"Stop Bidding Blind. Know What It's Really Worth." The homepage immediately addresses the core frustration—bidding without information—and promises instant clarity on true value. The angle emphasizes the transformation from uncertainty to confidence, positioning BidSmart as the Bloomberg Terminal for auction markets.
